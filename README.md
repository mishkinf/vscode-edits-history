# vscode-edits-history

A Visual Studio Extension that Provides the ability to quickly navigate back and forth between recently made edits

## Features

Set whatever key commands you wish to navigate backwards and forwards through your history of edits. Designed after the similar feature provided by IntelliJ based IDEs such as RubyMine, WebStorm, etc... This can be very useful when refactoring very long code files where you have to toggle back and forth between code or for just every day general coding use.

- Quick access back and forth between edits
- Works across multiple files
- Retails edit history after file renaming
